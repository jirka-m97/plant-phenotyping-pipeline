# plant-phenotyping-pipeline
This repository provides software for non-destructive plant phenotyping, developed at the Laboratory of Bioengineering, UCT Prague. It includes control of a robotic arm and motorised turntable, multispectral imaging for data processing and NDVI-based health assessment, and photogrammetric analysis via Metashape API for 3D plant reconstruction.
